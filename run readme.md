### run.py manual 
Before running run.py, I highly recommend running takepicture.py to adjust the camera settings to avoid saturating the pixels. 
I used this page on running a [NEMA Bipolar stepper motor with an L289N controller](https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/RpiMotorLib/blob/master/Documentation/Nema11L298N.md) from the [RpiMotorLib](https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/RpiMotorLib/tree/master) package to run this. I also used [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO/) to control power to the pins, of course. The picamera package is supposedly outdated but it worked well for me. If anyone decides to use this code, you should try to add a few lines to get the loop to break on a key press because I couldn't figure it out but it might have been useful. 

This is a pretty straightforward code and the only line you need to change when you run it is line 33, which picks out the directory to save the photos to. When using bwf2.py or bwf.py in conjunction, the variable ``count`` should match the name of the last image file in the folder, not the total number of files (e.g. there are 108 files but the last file is 107.png, then set count to 107).
