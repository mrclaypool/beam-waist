# beam-waist
Code to find the focal point of an OAP mirror. There are two parts to this project: the analysis code (bwf.py or bwf2.py) and the code for taking the photos/running the setup (run.py and takepicture.py). run.py will move a stepper motor using the library RPiMotorLib and take pictures between each step. The takepicture.py file is just to bring up a display of the camera before you start run.py.
