# beam-waist
Code to find the focal point of an OAP mirror. This is for a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, an L298N Motor Driver, and a Nema 17 Hybrid Stepper motor with a Break-Beam Sensor to stop the motor. There are two parts to this project: the analysis code (bwf.py or bwf2.py) and the code for taking the photos/running the setup (run.py and takepicture.py). run.py will move a stepper motor using the library [RPiMotorLib](https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/RpiMotorLib/tree/master) and take pictures between each step. The takepicture.py file is just to bring up a display of the camera before you start run.py.
